This web app will provide some basic statistics of an individual football player based on their position from the 2020 NFL season
For this app to work, the player's name must be spelled correctly and the player must play the same position as the position seleceted (E.g. Josh Allen is a quarterback so one must select the QB option and type in full "Josh Allen")
App will not display anything or change visualizations if the player information input is incorrect

Some examples to try out

QB: Josh Allen, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Justin Herbert
RB: Derrick Henry, Alvin Kamara, Adrian Peterson, Devin Singletary
WR: Davante Adams, Tyreek Hill, Mike Williams, Chase Claypool
TE: Travis Kelce, George Kittle, Jared Cook, Logan Thomas

Note: The data sets have been hard coded to stop after a certain number of players are read in order prevent the charts from being misrepresented by players with little to no statistics
